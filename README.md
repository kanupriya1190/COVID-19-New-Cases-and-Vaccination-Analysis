# COVID-19-New-Cases-and-Vaccination-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a dynamic and interactive Looker dashboard analyzing global COVID-19 trends and vaccination impacts from January 2020 to May 2023. The analysis showcases pre- and post-vaccination trends, identifying key insights into the relationship between vaccination rates and new COVID-19 cases worldwide.

### Key Features:
- **Pre-Post Vaccination Analysis:** Demonstrated a significant rise of over 1 million average new COVID-19 cases per day post-50% global vaccination coverage on October 28, 2021.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Created a live Looker dashboard for real-time monitoring of global COVID-19 cases, vaccination metrics, and regional trends.
- **Automation Pipeline:** Integrated data pipelines using Snowflake, HighTouch, Google Sheets, and Looker for automated daily updates.
- **Quantitative Findings:** Highlighted regional trends, vaccination impacts, and key metrics like the stringency index and human development index (HDI) in the context of COVID-19 cases.

## Tools & Skills
- **Data Tools:** Snowflake, Google Sheets, HighTouch, Looker, Microsoft Excel
- **Data Transformation & Analysis:** SQL, data visualization
- **Dashboard Development:** Real-time visualizations with Looker
- **Data Pipeline Automation:** Ensured seamless daily updates to reflect live trends

## Findings
- Spikes in new cases globally during early 2022 were attributed to the Omicron variant and relaxed restrictions.
- Regional analyses showed Asia's sharp rise in December 2022 due to China's policy shifts.
- A decline in global cases by late 2022-2023 was driven by vaccination campaigns, natural immunity, and public health measures.

## Key Data Visualizations
1. **Global New COVID-19 Cases:** Time series showcasing spikes and trends.
2. **Regional Vaccination Rates:** Pie chart for comparative analysis by continent.
3. **Stringency Index by Continent:** Bar chart to analyze the relationship between policies and case trends.
4. **Top HDI Continents with New Cases:** Highlighting the relationship between HDI and case numbers.

## Summary of Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Cases Data:** Includes fields like `new_cases_smoothed`, `total_cases`, and `new_deaths`.
- **Vaccination Data:** Includes fields like `new_vaccinations_smoothed`, `stringency_index`, and `HDI`.

## Impact
This project highlights how data visualization and automation can provide critical insights into global health crises. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and public health policies in reducing case numbers.
